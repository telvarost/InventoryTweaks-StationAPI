# Final Beta

**There's a very high chance this mod will not work in multiplayer, as of right now it is purely for singleplayer**

## List of tweaks from original mod

The following features were added to the InventoryTweaks mod but were not a part of the original:

Allowing pressure plates to be place-able on fences.

The following features were removed either because I failed to port them correctly and so disabled them or because they might conflict with the same or similar fix in the AnnoyanceFix mod:

<details><summary>Updated list of blocks that pickaxes and axes can mine quicker (Fixed in AnnoyanceFix-StationAPI)</summary>

**Extra pickaxe blocks:**
- Cobblestone stairs
- Redstone ore
- Iron door
- Bricks
- Furnaces
- Dispensers
- Stone pressure plates
- Rails
- Detector rails
- Powered rails
- Pistons
- Sticky pistons

**Extra axe blocks:**
- Wooden stairs
- Door
- Pressure plates
- Jukebox
- Note blocks
- Pumpkins
- Signs
- Trapdoors
- Ladders
- Crafting tables
- Fences

</details>

<details><summary>Stairs will now drop themselves rather than cobble/planks (Fixed in AnnoyanceFix-StationAPI)</summary>

Before:<br>
<video controls src="https://i.imgur.com/QSq8E8m.mp4" />

After:<br>
<video controls src="https://i.imgur.com/l5arDtA.mp4" />

</details>

<details><summary>Fixes saddled pigs not dropping their saddles on death (Fixed in AnnoyanceFix-StationAPI)</summary>

Before:
<video controls src="https://i.imgur.com/PVLRNn5.mp4"/>

After:
<video controls src="https://i.imgur.com/0yHHfxB.mp4" />

</details>

<details><summary>Two different config options to handle how boats break (Fixed in AnnoyanceFix-StationAPI, although with less config)</summary>

- Default config (value of 2) allows boats to break only when they crash with almost maximum speed. Making them less likely to break randomly.
- A value of 1 disables boat breaking logic entirely.

</details>

<details><summary>Items can now be repaired at crafting tables (Fixed in AnnoyanceFix-StationAPI)</summary>

<video controls src="https://i.imgur.com/UrLHQDh.mp4" />

</details>

<details><summary>Dyed wool can be turned back into white wool using bone meal (Fixed in MostlyModernRecipes-StationAPI)</summary>

<video controls src="https://i.imgur.com/Uwk3K2t.mp4" />

</details>

<details><summary>Fixes bookshelves not dropping anything when mined (Fixed in AnnoyanceFix-StationAPI)</summary>

Before:<br>
<video controls src="https://i.imgur.com/9dt46cf.mp4"/>

After:<br>
<video controls src="https://i.imgur.com/v9nEcfp.mp4" />

</details>

<details><summary>Fixes double doors not working with pressure plates (Fixed in VanillaBlockEnhancements, sort of)</summary>

Before:<br>
<video controls src="https://i.imgur.com/WWcOZA0.mp4"/>

After:<br>
<video controls src="https://i.imgur.com/8Dj19lR.mp4" />

**Note**: This is not the prettiest of fixes and edge cases might still exist as I didn't test it in normal gameplay for long periods of time. If you experience any issues with already placed doors break them and then place them again, this should fix them.

</details>

As well as a few of other minor issues:
- replaces the fence's bulky hitbox with a more slim version (Fixed in AnnoyanceFix-StationAPI)
- made the chicken hitbox slightly taller (Fixed in AnnoyanceFix-StationAPI)
- removing the useless 10mb array wasting resources (Fixed in SmoothBeta I would guess)

## List of changes

### Quality of Life changes

<details><summary>Sugar canes can now be places on sand (planned to be removed since change is already in AnnoyanceFix)</summary>

![sugar cane on sand](https://i.imgur.com/N7WjSx8.png)

</details>

<details><summary>More sounds</summary>

- Opening / closing chests
- Minecarts
- Items breaking

**Note: The mod doesn't add any sounds by itself, all of these sounds are already present in your "resources" folder, they are automatically downloaded by Minecraft itself**

</details>

<details><summary>Adds Clouds toggle in Video Settings</summary>

<video controls src="https://i.imgur.com/MUmqtmM.mp4" />

After:
![bunch of animals without any additional UI elements above them](https://i.imgur.com/TEKQyW2.png)

</details>

<details><summary>Added amount of ingame days and real life days of playtime in F3 overlay</summary>

![white text showingcasing the number of days spent in game](https://i.imgur.com/clje0xb.png)

**Format: ingame days (real life days)**
Both are calculated using the play time stat the player has, which means if the stats file gets corrupted or deleted these numbers will reset as well!

</details>

Before:
![torches without a bottom texture](https://i.imgur.com/pueAKg3.png)

After:
InventoryTweaks-StationAPI Edition fixes this differently than the cursed legacy version of the mod.
The fix in this version of the mod uses a json model that adds some tilted pixels to the bottom of the torches.

</details>

<details><summary>Fixes furnaces consuming the buckets as well when using lava buckets</summary>

Before:<br>

As well as a bunch of other minor issues not worth having before/after images such as:

- fixes grass block items being rendered incorrectly
- allows the use of `shift` key to drop the entire held stack and to exit vehicles
- adds a config option that disables nightmares (mosters spawning at your bed while sleeping), disabled by default
- adds a config option that disables bed functionality (so no more spawn point setting or night skipping), disabled by default
